## Getting started with third party integration

The following components are Babbage compliant and will be supported during and
after the hard-fork.

- [`cardano-node`](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-node) - the latest
  cardano-node, which supports Ouroboros Praos.

- [`cardano-db-sync`](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-db-sync) - a
  necessary middleware to power both cardano-rest and cardano-graphql. This
  middleware stores blockchain data fetched from cardano-node in an intermediate
  database to enable higher-level interfaces for blockchain exploration.

- [`cardano-wallet`](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-wallet) - This
  API is recommended for 3rd party wallets and exchanges who do not want to
  manage UTxOs for transactions themselves. Use it to send and receive payments
  from hierarchical deterministic wallets on the Cardano blockchain via HTTP
  REST or a command-line interface.

- [`cardano-graphql`](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-graphql) - HTTP
  GraphQL API for Cardano. A more flexible alternative for blockchain
  exploration than cardano-rest.

- [`Adrestia libraries`](https://github.com/input-output-hk/adrestia) -
  Recommended for larger exchanges who wish to construct their own wallet scheme
  and manage UTXOs themselves. This consists of the following:

  - [`cardano-coin-selection`](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-coin-selection)
  - [`cardano-addresses`](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-addresses)
  - [`cardano-transactions`](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-transactions)
  - [`cardano-serialization-lib`](https://github.com/Emurgo/cardano-serialization-lib)
  - [`bech32`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0173.mediawiki)

The only currently available language target is Haskell, although support for
JavaScript is being worked on and should be available soon.

Also, see the [compatibility matrix](https://docs.cardano.org/tools/comp-matrix)
and latest [release notes](https://docs.cardano.org/tools/release-notes).
