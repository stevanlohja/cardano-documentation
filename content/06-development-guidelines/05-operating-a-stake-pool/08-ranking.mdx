In the Daedalus wallet and Cardano Explorer, stake pools are ranked based on the
amount of rewards that users will receive if they choose to delegate to those
pools. Ranking shows pool saturation level, simplifying the pool choice. From a
delegator's perspective, once a pool reaches a certain saturation point, it will
no longer be beneficial to delegate to it. The most attractive stake pools are
displayed first and ordered from the top down.

The ranking system is designed to provide users with the ability to choose the
most suitable stake pool for a higher return on investment (ROI), so reliable
stake pool operators can maintain and support the system and maximize
decentralization.

### Ranking parameters

A pool's ranking is based on several parameters: cost and margin, the pool's
performance, and the amount of stake that the pool has already accumulated.
These factors promote reliable stake pools that are not yet saturated and
provide low cost and margin.
