metaTitle: Stake pool performance

A stake pool elected as a slot leader is responsible for producing new blocks
for the Cardano network. If the stake pool does not produce a block, the slot
will remain empty and the blockchain will _not_ be extended. The Cardano
blockchain can tolerate a number of missing blocks, but the majority of blocks
expected to be produced (at least 50% + 1) must be generated during an epoch.

Although occasionally missed blocks don’t affect the extension of the blockchain
as a whole, an unresponsive elected stake pool decreases the overall performance
of the network, which is undesirable.

Stake pool performance is calculated according to its expected activity as the
ratio of a number of blocks a stake pool produces in a given epoch versus the
number it was capable to produce. For instance, if the stake pool could produce
100 blocks (based on its stake and the chance to be elected) in an epoch, but it
actually produced just 50 blocks, its performance would be 50%.

Poor stake pool performance decreases the number of rewards that a pool and its
members receive, thereby decreasing its attractiveness to delegators. To improve
its performance, a stake pool should have good network connectivity, be run on a
reliable system, and actively participate in block production and verification.

The higher the pool’s performance, the more attractive it will be to delegators
since it will offer higher rewards and incentives.
