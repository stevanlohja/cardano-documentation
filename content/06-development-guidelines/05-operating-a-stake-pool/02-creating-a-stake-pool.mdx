### Prerequisites for stake pool operators

As a stake pool operator for Cardano, you will typically have the following
abilities:

- operational knowledge of how to set up, run and maintain a Cardano node
  continuously
- a commitment to maintain your node 24/7/365
- system operation skills
- server administration skills (operational and maintenance).
- experience of development and operations (DevOps) would be very useful

**Hardware requirements**

In terms of hardware, you should ensure you have the following:

- 10 GB of RAM
- 24 GB of hard disk space
- a good network connection and about 1 GB of bandwidth per hour
- a public IP4 address

Note that processor speed is not a significant factor for running a stake pool.

### Setting up a stake pool

First, you should [install the node from source](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-node/blob/master/doc/getting-started/install.md).


You can then proceed with the following operational tasks for managing your stake pool:

**Set up**

- [Configuration and topology files](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-node/blob/master/doc/stake-pool-operations/1_getConfigFiles_AND_Connect.md)
- [Configuring topology files for block-producing and relay nodes](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-node/blob/master/doc/stake-pool-operations/0_core_relay.md)
- [Creating keys and addresses](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-node/blob/master/doc/stake-pool-operations/3_keys_and_addresses.md)
- [Generating stake pool keys](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-node/blob/master/doc/stake-pool-operations/6_node_keys.md)
- [Registering key stake address on the blockchain](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-node/blob/master/doc/stake-pool-operations/5_register_key.md)
- [Creating an operational certificate with key evolving signature (KES)](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-node/blob/master/doc/stake-pool-operations/7_KES_period.md)
- [Registering a stake pool with metadata](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-node/blob/master/doc/stake-pool-operations/8_register_stakepool.md)
- [Starting a node](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-node/blob/master/doc/stake-pool-operations/2_start_your_nodes.md)
- [Creating a simple transaction](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-node/blob/master/doc/stake-pool-operations/4_simple_transaction.md)

**Maintenance**

- [Leadership schedule](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-node/blob/master/doc/stake-pool-operations/9_leadership_schedule.md)
- [Querying a stake pool snapshot](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-node/blob/master/doc/stake-pool-operations/10_query_stakepool.md)
- [Generating new operational certificate and keys](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-node/blob/master/doc/stake-pool-operations/7_KES_period.md#issue-new-counter-and-operational-certificate)
- [Withdrawing rewards](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-node/blob/master/doc/stake-pool-operations/11_withdraw-rewards.md)
- [Retiring a stake pool](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-node/blob/master/doc/stake-pool-operations/12_retire_stakepool.md)
