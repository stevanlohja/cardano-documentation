Nodes connect to each other within the Cardano networking layer, and this
connection is essential for information exchange about transactions and new
block creation.

### Cardano networking

With Byron, federated nodes were wholly responsible for managing block
production and network connections. The Byron network consisted of a set of
federated core nodes - static nodes that produced blocks and maintained the
Cardano network. With the launch of Shelley, the network runs in a hybrid mode
with federated nodes operated by IOG (which configure connections between
different stake pool operators) and nodes operated by the SPO community. The
percentage of blocks produced by decentralized nodes is constantly growing while
federated nodes gradually stop operating, which evenly spreads the network
maintenance across all the stake pool operators. Over the lifetime of the
Shelley system, the network will transition into full decentralization using
continuous automatic discovery and selection of peers.

During the initial phase, nodes connect to other nodes by means of a static
configuration, defined in a topology file. To avoid a situation when relay nodes
go offline, which causes the block-producing nodes to be inaccessible, it is
crucial to connect to reliable relay nodes. Currently, IOG offers
[a list of all registered relays categorized by geographical location](https://explorer.cardano-mainnet.iohk.io/relays/topology.json)
for SPOs to consider for connection purposes. It is also recommended that SPOs
generate a configuration that uses 20 other SPOs as peers. In practice, many
SPOs can use more than 20 peers for connection purposes. The list allows to
select peers that are both nearby and far away so that there is strong
inter-region connectivity.

Before the network is moved from federated to fully decentralized, the node’s
network layer will be switched to use continuous automatic discovery and peer
selection. This will be achieved through upgrades to the network stack.
Initially, this will enable improved automation of connecting SPO relays to each
other so that less static configuration is needed. Ultimately it will enable a
full peer-to-peer (P2P) topology for all Cardano nodes, which will make the
network less reliant on IOG-run relays.

### Connecting core and relay nodes

As a stake pool operator, you will have two types of nodes: core nodes and relay
nodes. Each core node must be accompanied by one or more relay nodes.

The difference between the two types is that core nodes are responsible for
producing blocks, while relays are responsible for communicating with other
relays in the network and broadcasting blocks. This difference determines how
they are configured and how they are connected to the network.

A core node is configured with various key-pairs and an operational certificate
needed for block generation. It only connects to its relay nodes.

**Instructions to configure a node and create an operational certificate:**

- [About node configuration files](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-node/blob/master/doc/getting-started/understanding-config-files.md)
- [Configuring topology files for block-producing and relay nodes](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-node/blob/master/doc/stake-pool-operations/0_core_relay.md)
- [Creating an operational certificate with key evolving signature (KES)](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-node/blob/master/doc/stake-pool-operations/7_KES_period.md)

A relay node doesn’t need any keys and will therefore be unable to produce
blocks. It is connected to its core node, other relays, and external nodes.

Each node should run on a dedicated server, and the core node server’s firewall
should be configured to only allow incoming connections from its relays.
