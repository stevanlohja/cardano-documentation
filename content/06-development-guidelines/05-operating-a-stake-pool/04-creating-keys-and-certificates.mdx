### About the stake pool operator keys

It is the responsibility of the operator to manage both the hot (online), and
cold (offline) keys for the pool. Cold keys must be secure and should not reside
on a device that has internet connectivity. It is recommended that you have
multiple backups of your cold keys.

The keys that you need as a stake pool operator are:

- stake pool cold key
- stake pool hot key (KES key)
- stake pool VRF key

The KES key, or hot key as mentioned above, is a node operational key that
authenticates who you are. You specify the validity of the KES key using the
start time and key period parameters and this KES key needs to be updated every
90 days. The VRF key is a signing verification key and is stored within the
operational certificate. You can read more information on these crypto scheme
keys in the
[Shelley ledger specification](https://hydra.iohk.io/build/5096921/download/1/ledger-spec.pdf).

### Creating an operational certificate

Stake pool operators must provide an operational certificate to verify that the
pool has the authority to run. The certificate includes the operator’s signature
and important information about the pool (addresses, keys, etc.)

Operational certificates represent the link between the operator’s offline key
and their operational key. A certificate’s job is to check whether or not an
operational key is valid, to prevent malicious interference. The certificate
identifies the current operational key, and is signed by the offline key.

Certificates are generated with an issue counter number and included in the
header of each block the node generates. Note that with the Vasil hard fork, an operator would need to create an operational certificate using cold.counter +1. This means that the `OpCert` must be exactly one more than the previously used one. 

Certificates include a kes-period (start date), which indicates the time span
within which the certificate is valid before you need to create another one.

**Instructions to work with operational certificates:**

- [Creating an operational certificate with KES](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-node/blob/master/doc/stake-pool-operations/7_KES_period.md)
- [Registering stake address and creating a registration certificate](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-node/blob/master/doc/stake-pool-operations/8_register_stakepool.md#generate-stake-pool-registration-certificate)

The counter becomes significant when an attacker has compromised the KES key, in
which case the owner of the cold keys can create a new KES key and a new
certificate with a higher issue number. If a node sees two blocks claiming to
originate from the same cold key, but using different KES keys, the higher issue
counter trumps the lower one.

Certificates are generated on the offline machine using the offline/cold keys,
before being copied over to the node to validate the KES keys used to sign the
blocks.
