A _smart contract_ is an automated digital agreement, written in code, that
tracks, verifies, and executes the binding transactions of a contract between
various parties. The transactions of the contract are automatically executed by
the smart contract code when predetermined conditions are met. Essentially, a
smart contract is a short program whose inputs and outputs are transactions on a
blockchain.

Smart contracts are self executing and reliable and do not require the actions
or presence of third parties. The smart contract code is stored on, and
distributed across, a decentralised blockchain network, making it transparent
and irreversible.

In summary, smart contracts are immutable as a contract cannot be changed, they
are distributable and tamper-proof, fast and cost effective, as there is no
middle man which saves money and time, and is safe due to encryption.

Cardano introduced smart contract support in 2021. As a multi-functional
environment, Cardano supports the development and deployment of smart
contracts using such programming languages as:

- **Plutus** — a purpose-built smart contract development and execution
  platform. Plutus contracts consist of parts that run on the blockchain
  (on-chain code) and parts that run on a user’s machine (off-chain or client
  code). Plutus draws from modern language research to provide a safe,
  full-stack programming environment based on Haskell, the leading functional
  programming language.
- **Marlowe** — a domain-specific language (DSL) for writing and executing
  financial contracts that allows building contracts visually as well as in more
  traditional code. Financial institutions can use it to develop and deploy
  custom instruments for their customers and clients, for example. The Marlowe
  language itself is now embedded in both JavaScript and Haskell offering a
  choice of editors depending on developers’ preference and skillset.
