>Before you start, note that Plutus Core, Cardanoâ€™s native smart contract language, is written in Haskell. Plutus contracts are effectively Haskell programs and that is why it is essential to know the basics of Haskell before enrolling in the Plutus Pioneer program. 

>Join a new Haskell Bootcamp course. With unique code examples and interesting homework that has prepared solutions you can learn the fundamentals of Haskell and be prepared.

## What is the Plutus Pioneer program?

It is a program to recruit and train developers in Plutus for the Cardano ecosystem. When you join this program, you will become part of a group with access to a set of courses that teach you the core principles of how to code in both Haskell and Plutus. It will be highly interactive, with weekly videos, exercises, and Q&A sessions, along with exclusive access to the creators and key experts in the language. You will also be able to join a dedicated community channel, created to help pioneers connect to each other as you learn.

## What prior experience do I need?

This course is not for coding beginners. While you do not need to be an expert in formal methods, programming experience and a general aptitude for logical and mathematical thinking are highly desirable. Some prior knowledge of Haskell or functional programming is also recommended, as Plutus is heavily based on Haskell and includes advanced features like Template Haskell, type-level programming, and effect systems. We recommend that you read the  [Learn You a Haskell guide](http://learnyouahaskell.com/)  before taking the course.

Please register your interest using the form below and we will be in touch.

## What can I expect to learn?

This course involves approximately ten hours a week of your time and efforts. It covers the building blocks of Haskell and Plutus, including:

-   Functions and data types
-   Type classes
-   Monads
-   Template Haskell
-   Using the Plutus Playground
-   Extended UTXO model
-   Working with Plutus (on and off the chain)
-   Minting policies
-   State machines
-   The Plutus application framework (PAF)
-   The Plutus application backend (PAB)
-   Some case studies and practical exercises

As with all learning experiences, the more you put in the more you will get out!

## When can I join?

Our third course has just finished. Depending on demand, we plan to open up a fourth cohort later in the summer, so please register your interest today to hear more in due course.

## How can I register for the Plutus Pioneer program?

If you are interested in joining a future cohort of this program, please complete the registration form below. You will receive a short application form, and we will be in touch when we have fresh course dates to offer.

## Will I be certified?

Yes, we will be awarding certificates to those pioneers who successfully complete the entire program. Certificates will be represented as non-fungible tokens (NFTs) (on the testnet) and locked by a Plutus contract. Pioneers can demonstrate their qualification by constructing an appropriate transaction to unlock their individual token.
