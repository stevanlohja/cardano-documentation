>Note: New dedicated *preview* and *pre-production* environments have been recently spun up for the final stages of testing Vasil functionality. These environments offer improved chain density and a better developer experience.

>We recommend that all developers, SPOs, and exchanges use these environments rather than the main Cardano testnet. For more details, see [environments overview](https://docs.cardano.org/cardano-testnet/getting-started/#environments).

Vasil enforces the next major upgrade to the Cardano protocol using [Cardanoâ€™s hard fork combinator (HFC) approach](https://docs.cardano.org/learn/about-hard-forks). This upgrade is named after a much loved and respected Cardano community member, Vasil St Dabov.

Vasil brings changes that improve [the handling of on-chain (Plutus) scripts](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2022/04/13/boosting-cardano-s-throughput-with-script-referencing/), reducing user costs and allowing [greater script throughput](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2022/03/21/increasing-the-transaction-throughput-of-cardano/). Vasil changes form the first stages of a series of planned improvements that will be rolled out over time.

More specifically, this upgrade introduces:

-   Diffusion pipelining
-   Plutus V2 (a tuned interpreter, and a new cost model)
-   New Plutus built-ins
-   Plutus reference inputs
-   Plutus inline datums
-   Plutus reference scripts
-   Collateral change address
-   Transaction redeemers changes
-   Single VRF implementation

To get started, make sure to:

* upgrade your [node configuration, topology, and genesis files](https://book.world.dev.cardano.org/environments.html)
* check the ['Getting started' tutorial](/cardano-testnet/getting-started)
* see [Vasil testnet tutorials](https://github.com/input-output-hk/Vasil-testnet)
* see [Babbage script examples](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-node/tree/master/doc/reference/plutus)

Also, note that:

-  With the Vasil hard fork on mainnet, the *d* parameter is removed and block production is now fully decentralized. This prevents re-federation.
-   If you are an SPO, you now need to create your operational certificate using cold.counter +1. The `OpCert` must be exactly one more than the previously used one. [See details here](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-node/blob/master/doc/stake-pool-operations/7_KES_period.md#warning-vasil-hard-fork-breaking-changes)
-   The `minUTxO` formula is now calculated using original bytes instead of `lovelacePerUTxOWord`. For more details, see [CIP-55](https://cips.cardano.org/cips/cip55/).
