import Faucet from '../../../src/components/Faucet'

Since the Cardano testnet is an independent network, separate from the Cardano
mainnet, it requires its own tokens.

The faucet is a web-based service that provides test ada to users of the
Cardano testnets. While these tokens have no 'real world' value, they enable
users to experiment with Cardano testnet features, without having to spend real
ada on the mainnet.

**To request tokens using the faucet:**

1. Enter the address of the account where you want to top up funds.
2. If you have been issued with an API key, please enter this to access any
   additional funds you may have been allocated.
3. Click **Receive test ada**.
4. Funds will be in the testnet account you specified within a few minutes.

**Delegation**

If you're an SPO and wish to test stake pool operations on preview or pre-production testnets, you can request some test ada to be delegated to your pool. For this, choose the environment you're working in, and select 'receive pool delegation' from the action menu.

_When you have finished using your test tokens, please return them to the faucet
so that other members of the community can use them. Please return your test
tokens to this address:_
