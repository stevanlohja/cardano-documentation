Staking calculator is a tool used to predict approximate rewards a user may
receive by delegating ada to a stake pool. Note that the rewards predicted by
this calculator are only an **estimate**.

The actual amount of ada received in rewards may vary, and will depend on a
number of factors, including actual stake pool performance, which is the number
of blocks a stake pool is observed to produce in a given epoch versus the number
it was expected to produce. Changes to network parameters may also affect
rewards.

The annualized equivalent returns given by this calculator assume that stake is
delegated to the same stake pool for a 365-day period, and that stake pool
performance and other settings are consistent over that timeframe. IOG accepts
no responsibility for any discrepancy between estimated and actual rewards,
**this calculator is provided for guidance only.**
