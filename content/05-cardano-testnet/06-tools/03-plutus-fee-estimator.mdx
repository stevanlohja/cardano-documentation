The Plutus fee estimator has been developed by IOG performance experts for price
benchmarking and comparison. It uses information from real-world Plutus
transactions and current mainnet settings to predict the fees that will be
charged for a transaction. The estimator can be used to calculate fees for
actual transactions (e.g. to determine the fees that will be charged if the
network parameters change), and also to estimate fees for individual script
transactions or complete DApps before or during development. It may be useful to
determine the effect of script changes or optimizations on fees.

The fee estimator needs three simple pieces of information:

- **The total on-chain transaction size in bytes**: a simple transaction, for
  example, is around 300 bytes, one with metadata is around 650 bytes, and
  Plutus scripts are typically 4,000-8,000 bytes (future optimizations and
  improvements will reduce this).
- **The number of computational (CPU) steps** that the script uses: each step
  represents 1 picosecond of execution time on a benchmark machine. Typical
  scripts should consume less than 1,000,000,000 (1 millisecond).
- **The number of memory units** that the script uses: this represents the
  number of bytes that the script allocates. Typical scripts should consume less
  than 1,000,000 memory units (1MB of memory allocation).

It calculates the cost for the corresponding transaction using current mainnet
parameter settings, providing results in both ada and US dollars.

The information that the fee estimator uses can either be obtained:

- directly from a specific Plutus transaction using the Cardano node
- from information that the Plutus system provides.

Users may also provide estimated values if they want to explore what-if
scenarios. This allows a range of possible fee estimates to be obtained prior to
or during smart contract development, which facilitates experimentation with
alternative implementation decisions.
