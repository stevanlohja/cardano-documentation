Interacting with the sidechain requires sending requests to specific JSON-RPC API methods. The EVM sidechain testnet supports most standard Ethereum JSON-RPC API endpoints with a few exceptions described below.

## Specification

The EVM sidechain testnet supports [OpenRPC](https://open-rpc.org/)'s `rpc.discover` service discovery method that will return the OpenRPC scheme for the JSON-RPC API. You can easily validate and preview the schema on the [OpenRPC Playground](https://playground.open-rpc.org/?schemaUrl=https://faucet.sidechain.evmtestnet.iohkdev.io/).

## Supported methods

The list below shows which Ethereum API methods are currently implemented in the Cardano EVM sidechain. For details of each method, you can refer to the [JSON-RPC specification](https://playground.open-rpc.org/?schemaUrl=https://faucet.sidechain.evmtestnet.iohkdev.io/).

*If your product requires a method that is not currently implemented, please contact Input Output Global support.*

# Available methods

- `eth_getBlockByHash`
- `eth_getBlockByNumber`  
- `eth_sendTransaction`  
- `eth_estimateGas`  
- `eth_getCode`  
- `eth_sendRawTransaction`  
- `eth_getTransactionReceipt`  
- `eth_call`  
- `eth_getBalance`  
- `eth_getStorageAt`  
- `eth_getBlockTransactionCountByHash`  
- `eth_getBlockTransactionCountByNumber`
- `eth_accounts`  
- `eth_blockNumber` 
- `eth_sign`
- `eth_getTransactionByHash`  
- `eth_getTransactionCount`  
- `eth_chainId`  
- `net_version`  
- `web3_clientVersion`
- `txpool_content`

## Bridge methods

These methods are specifically implemented to support bridge operations.

- `sidechain_getCandidates`
- `sidechain_getCommittee`
- `sidechain_getMainchainStatus`

## Test methods

These methods are in the Cardano EVM sidechain with their input/output types, but are not fully implemented yet. They just return an error and do nothing.  

- `test_mineBlocks`  
- `test_modifyTimestamp`  
- `test_rewindToBlock`  
- `test_setChainParams`  
- `test_importRawBlock`

## Debug methods  

These methods are there but they are specifically implemented to be just good enough for ETS.  

They are only available for the test node.  

They do not capture every possible storage address. As ETS uses trivial addresses such as 1-10 those are the only ones the methods check.  

For accounts, The only accounts checked are those that are known to exist (ie, they are in the genesis), but if an account is created inside a transaction it won't be returned.

- `debug_storageRangeAt`: optional  
- `debug_accountRange`: optional  
- `debug_traceTransaction endpoint`: optional

## Support for test tooling (Web3.js, Metamask…)

- `personal_newAccount`  
- `personal_listAccounts`  
- `personal_unlockAccount`  
- `personal_lockAccount`  
- `personal_sendTransaction`  
- `personal_sign`  
- `personal_ecRecover`  

# Not implemented yet  

- `eth_protocolVersion`  
- `eth_syncing`  
- `eth_coinbase`  
- `eth_feeHistory (This is specific to the London hard fork.)`  
- `eth_newFilter`  
- `eth_newBlockFilter`  
- `eth_newPendingTransactionFilter`  
- `eth_uninstallFilter`  
- `eth_getFilterChanges`  
- `eth_getFilterLogs`  
- `eth_getLogs`  
- `eth_mining` (There is no “mining” in the Cardano EVM sidechain but it can return if the node is a validator.)  
- `eth_sign`
- `eth_signTransaction`  
- `eth_getTransactionByBlockHashAndIndex`  
- `eth_getTransactionByBlockNumberAndIndex`
- `personal_importRawKey`  

The whole trace/debug module  

# Irrelevant methods

The following methods are irrelevant for the Cardano EVM sidechain because they are specific to proof of work. They can be implemented to return a fixed value if needed.  

- `eth_getUncleCountByBlockHash`  
- `eth_getUncleCountByBlockNumber`
- `eth_getWork`  
- `eth_submitWork` 
- `eth_hashrate`   
- `eth_submitHashrate`  
- `eth_getUncleByBlockHashAndIndex`  
- `eth_gasPrice`
