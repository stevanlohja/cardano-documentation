This tutorial will show you how to transfer `SC_Tokens` between the mainchain and a sidechain.

## Prerequisites

1. We will use the **sidechain-cli** and the **sc-evm-cli** components within this tutorial. Download the binaries and add them to your shellâ€™s path: https://github.com/input-output-hk/sidechains-tooling.
2. Download the **bech32** conversion tool binary and add to your shell's path: https://github.com/input-output-hk/bech32.
3. If you have not done so already, create and fund your main chain and sidechain accounts: [Create and funds your accounts](/cardano-sidechains/example-evm-sidechains/create-and-fund-accounts).

# Transfering tokens from a sidechain to the main chain

Transfering tokens from a sidechain to the main chain will require interfacing with the bridge contract to lock the desired amount of `SC_Token` to be claimed on the main chain.

### Step 01 - Lock SC_Token

The `lock` function of the bridge contract takes the main chain recipient's address, but the recipient address must be converted to **bech32** format.

- Determine how many `SC_Token` you want to lock. The amount in `SC_Token` has to be a multiple of 10^9. For example, 10^9 `wei` on the sidechain will be 1 `SC_Token` on the main chain.
Input the amount of `SC_Token`, in `wei`, you want to lock: eg, `1000000000` Wei == 1 `SC_Token`.

Set a few environment variables to make things easier:

```shell
SC_ADDR= # sidechain address
PRIV_SC_KEY= # private key for sidechain address
MC_ADDR= # mainchain recipient address
SC_Token_AMOUNT= # the amount of SC_Token to be converted
```

You can double-check environment variables by printing them to your shell: eg, `print $MC_ADDR`.

- Create the `lock` transaction:

```shell
# Get NONCE for SC_ADDR:
NONCE=`curl -L -X POST -H 'Content-type:application/json' -d '{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "method": "eth_getTransactionCount",
  "params": ["$SC_ADDR", "latest"],
  "id": 1
  }' https://faucet.sidechain.evmtestnet.iohkdev.io/ | jq -r '.result'`

# Convert to decimal:
NONCE=`echo "ibase=16; $NONCE"|bc`

TX_LOCK_HASH = sc-evm-cli create-lock-tx --nonce $NONCE --private-key $PRIV_SC_KEY $(bech32 <<< $MC_ADDR) $SC_Token_AMOUNT
```

**sc-evm-cli** will return the raw tx of the transaction which is stored in `TX_LOCK_HASH`.

- Submit the transaction by invoking the JSON-RPC API endpoint to `eth_sendRawTransaction`:

```shell
# Add 0x in front of the lock transaction hash:
TX_LOCK_HASH=0x$TX_LOCK_HASH

# Get Raw Tx Hash:
RAW_TX=`curl -L -X POST -H 'Content-type:application/json' -d '{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "method": "eth_sendRawTransaction",
  "params": [$TX_LOCK_HASH],
  "id": 1
  }' https://faucet.sidechain.evmtestnet.iohkdev.io/ | jq -r '.result'
```

- To verify the transaction was successful, simply `eth_getTransactionReceipt` of the raw transaction stored in `$RAW_TX`. You can request this until the receipt is returned or transaction times out:

```shell
curl -L -X POST -H 'Content-type:application/json' -d '{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "method": "eth_getTransactionReceipt",
  "params": [$RAW_TX],
  "id": 1
  }' https://faucet.sidechain.evmtestnet.iohkdev.io/ | jq
  ```

- Get the current sidechain status by invoking `sidechain_getStatus`:

```shell
curl -L -X POST -H 'Content-type:application/json' -d '{
   "jsonrpc": "2.0",
   "method": "sidechain_getStatus",
   "params": [],
   "id": 1
   }' https://faucet.sidechain.evmtestnet.iohkdev.io/ | jq -r
```

This shows on which epoch and phase the `lock()` transaction happened. If it happened during epoch `N` on epochPhase `regular` you can obtain the Merkle proof on epoch `N` since epochPhase changes to `handover`. If it happened during epoch `N` on epochPhase `closedTransactionBatch` or `handover`, you can obtain the Merkle proof on epoch `N+1` since epochPhase changes to `handover`.

- Get transaction index for the epoch the lock transaction will be processed:

```
curl -L -X POST -H 'Content-type:application/json' -d '{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "method": "sidechain_getOutgoingTransactions",
  "params": [<N or N+1>],
  "id": 1
  }' https://faucet.sidechain.evmtestnet.iohkdev.io/ | jq
```

Example output:

```json
{
  "proof": {
    "bytes": "0xd8799fd8799f0002581d606e9d4f6a3f900f7b510b27f29d8e79c550686ce093946b23b3d1828ed87a80ff80ff",
    "info": {
      "transaction": {
        "value": "0x2",
        "recipient": "0x606e9d4f6a3f900f7b510b27f29d8e79c550686ce093946b23b3d1828e",
        "txIndex": 0
      },
      "merkleRootHash": "0x96e0bffb3786607057ddffa5bc3a92c5b6669109c12b5222da374cd99a815b4e"
    }
  }
}
```

To obtain the `txIndex` matching the recipient and amount used to lock tokens, proceed as follows.

- Wait until the epochPhase changes to `handover` of epoch `N` or `N+1` and obtain the Merkle proof for your lock action:

```shell
curl -L -X POST -H 'Content-type:application/json' -d '{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "method": "sidechain_getOutgoingTxMerkleProof",
  "params": [<N or N+1>, <txIndex>],
  "id": 1
  }' https://faucet.sidechain.evmtestnet.iohkdev.io/ | jq
```

From the return you need to obtain the `proof/bytes` and remove the `0x` that is prepended. Call that string `merkleProof`.

- Wait until the epoch changes and the committee handover has happened. The committee handover happens automatically on the testnets by a service (relay) that tries every minute to find epoch signatures, and succeeds after a new epoch has started and the signatures are obtained. On mainnet, the committee handover will be done by anyone that wants, where there will be an incentive to do so. A good way to verify is by waiting until you observe your transaction in the list of signatures to upload:

```
curl -L -X POST -H 'Content-type:application/json' -d '{
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "method": "sidechain_getSignaturesToUpload",
    "params": [<limit>],
    "id": 1
    }' https://faucet.sidechain.evmtestnet.iohkdev.io/ | jq
```

Where `limit` = min(limit, number of epochs that are not yet relayed). The default value is `100`, but you can set it to any other number. In a normal case, when the handover happens at every epoch, it should only show 0 or 1 epochs (the last one). Once you identify that there are no roothashes pending in the list under the epoch that your lock was processed (`N` or `N+1`), you can claim your tokens. By now the epoch will be `N+1 `or `N+2`, depending on the phase you performed the lock operation.

- Finally, claim the tokens by submitting a transaction on the main chain with the `merkleProof` you obtained using the **sidechain-cli**: 

```shell
./sidechain-cli claim-SC_Token --sc-url https://faucet.sidechain.evmtestnet.iohkdev.io/ --signing-key-file /PATH/TO/payment.skey --combined-proof <merkleProof without 0x>
```

Example output: 

```
{
  "endpoint": "ClaimAct",
  "transactionId": "1334b3dab421911af68b9393e5cc4756c46c9ab1ac567a57450597e174351a48"
}
```

Verify amount you locked in your account:

```
cardano-cli query utxo --testnet-magic 7 --address $MC_ADDR
```

ðŸŽ‰ Congratulations! At this point, you have successfully claimed your `SC_Token` on the main chain.

# Transfering tokens from the main chain to a sidechain

### Step 01 - Burn SC_Token

To transfer `SC_Token` from the main chain to a sidechain, use the **sidechain-cli** to burn main chain `SC_Token`.

```shell
./sidechain-cli burn-SC_Token
  --signing-key-file payment.skey \
  --sc-url https://faucet.sidechain.evmtestnet.iohkdev.io/ \
  --recipient ae3dffee97f92db0201d11cb8877c89738353bce \
  --amount 10
```

Understanding this command:

- `--signing-key-file payment.skey`: Generating a main chain account creates a `.skey` file to sign transactions. The command gives the path to this file.
-  `--sc-url https://faucet.sidechain.evmtestnet.iohkdev.io/`: Providing the JSON-RPC API url, or endpoint, to the sidechain network node.
-   `--recipient ae3dffee97f92db0201d11cb8877c89738353bce`: Defines the destination address on the sidechain where the SC_Token tokens will appear.

-  `--amount 10`: Defines the amount of `SC_Token` (on the mainchain) to be burned for `SC_Token` (on the sidechain) at the conversion rate of `amount`x`10^9`.

The transaction will be stable on the main chain in approximately 12 minutes or 36 blocks. The sidechain will then add it to a produced block and the tokens should appear in the sidechain-account balance:

- Check `SC_Token` token balance using the [JSON-RPC API](/cardano-sidechains/example-evm-sidechains/api): 

```shell
curl -L -X POST https://faucet.sidechain.evmtestnet.iohkdev.io/ -H 'Content-type:application/json' -d '{
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "method": "eth_getBalance",
    "params": ["0xae3dffee97f92db0201d11cb8877c89738353bce", "latest"],
    "id": 1}'
```

Tip: Balance may be checked on a compatible Web3 wallet configured to the EVM sidechain testnet network.

ðŸŽ‰ Congratulations! At this point, you have successfully burned your main chain `SC_Token` for a native sidechain `SC_Token`.
