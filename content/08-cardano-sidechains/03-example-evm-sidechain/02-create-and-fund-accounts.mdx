# How to fund your main chain account with test ada tokens

In this tutorial, you will learn how to claim test ada tokens on the main chain testnet.

## Generating keys

To generate keys for the Cardano testnet you need the `cardano-cli` [binary](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-node/releases/).
Open a shell and run the following commands:

```shell
# Set network name
network=--testnet-magic=7

cardano-cli address key-gen \
    --verification-key-file payment.vkey \
    --signing-key-file payment.skey

cardano-cli address build \
    --payment-verification-key-file payment.vkey \
    --out-file payment.addr \
    $network

 export MC_ADDR=$(cat payment.addr)
```

These steps are based on this [keys and adresses creation tutorial](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-node/blob/master/doc/stake-pool-operations/3_keys_and_addresses.md).

Request test ada using [the web-app](https://faucet.cardano.evmtestnet.iohkdev.io/basic-faucet).

# How to fund your sidechain account with test SC_token

Create a sidechain account using a compatible Web3 connected to the EVM sidechain test network (MetaMask), 
1a. or using `evm-sc-cli`: https://github.com/input-output-hk/sidechains-tooling

```shell
evm-sc-cli generate-keys --type ecdsa
```
