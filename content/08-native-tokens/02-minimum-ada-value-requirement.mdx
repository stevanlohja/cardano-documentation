title: Minimum ada value requirement
metaTitle: Minimum ada value requirement
---

UTXOs on the ledger may contain a heterogeneous collection of tokens, including ada, which is a limited resource in the Cardano system. Requiring some amount of ada to be included in every UTXO (where that amount is based on the size of the UTXO, in bytes), limits the maximum total size taken up by UTXO entries on the ledger at any given time.

The maximum possible UTXO size (the sum of the sizes of all UTXO entries) is implicitly adjusted by raising and lowering the `min-ada-value` variable, which is calculated using the Alonzo parameter `coinsPerUTxOWord`. In this way, the constraint protects the Cardano ledger from growing beyond a certain size. A ledger without a size bound is vulnerable to being populated by so much data that users will unable to process it (or run a node) with machines meeting the recommended specifications for running a node.

In the multi-asset Cardano ledger, UTXO entries have different sizes. In particular, any entries containing a non-ada asset contain records of the Policy IDs, asset names, and quantities of each of the non-ada assets. To maintain the max UTXO size bound on the UTXO stored on the ledger with variable entry sizes, we must adjust the minimum ada value for each UTXO entry, based on its size.  

The minimum number of ada required is [calculated using this method](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger/blob/master/doc/explanations/min-utxo-alonzo.rst) that is new in the Alonzo era.

> Note that with an upcoming upgrade to Babbage era, the protocol parameter `coinsPerUTxOWord` changes to `coinsPerUTxOByte`, which means that the price will be calculated per one byte instead of per eight bytes. The calculation will therefore look as follows: `minUTxoVal = (160 + sizeInBytes (TxOut)) * coinsPerUTxOByte`. For more details, see [CIP-55](https://cips.cardano.org/cips/cip55/).

As a consequence of this design,

- It is impossible to make outputs containing only custom tokens
- The number of each token kind in an output can slightly affect the min-ada-value of this output. This is because the minimum UTXO value takes memory overhead into account when storing it on a running computer. The increase in ada value affects the memory overhead *insignificantly*, however, adding more multi-assets affects this value much more. The reason for this is that the names and policy IDs of each of the types of tokens take up additional space in the output. For efficient encoding, see [the CBOR specification](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8949#name-specification-of-the-cbor-e).
- Sending custom tokens to an address always involves sending the min-ada-value of ada to that address alongside the custom tokens (by including the ada in the same output). If - the address is not spendable by the user sending the tokens, the ada sent alongside the tokens no longer belongs to the sender.
- Before transferring custom tokens, users may choose to use off-chain communication to negotiate who supplies the ada to cover the min-ada-value in the output made by the transferring transaction
- To recover the ada stored alongside custom tokens in an output O, the user must either: a) Spend the output O, and burn the custom tokens stored therein b) Spend an output O and an output O’, and consolidate the tokens therein with the same collection of types of custom tokens stored in another output (spent within the same transaction)
Eg., `(CryptoDoggiesPolicy, poodle, 1)` contained in O can be consolidated with `(CryptoDoggiesPolicy, poodle, 3)` in O’, for a total of `(CryptoDoggiesPolicy, poodle, 4)` in a new output made by the consolidating transaction.
- Splitting custom tokens into more outputs than they were contained in before the transaction getting processed requires using, in total, more ada to cover the min-ada-value, as ada is needed in the additional outputs.
