The Cardano node is the core component that underpins the network and enables
you to participate in the [Cardano](https://cardano.org/) decentralized blockchain. Ultimately, a
blockchain network is just a collection of interconnected nodes, all working
together to validate transactions and blocks by means of consensus. The
definition of consensus for any given network varies, but for the Cardano
network it is defined by the [Ouroboros protocol](https://docs.cardano.org/learn/ouroboros-overview). By running a Cardano node, you
are participating in and contributing to the network.

This [cardano-node](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-node) is the top
level component for the node and aggregates a number of other components from
other packages: consensus, ledger and networking, configuration, command line interface (CLI), as well as
logging and monitoring. Note that cardano-node no longer incorporates wallet or
explorer functionality. The wallet backend (WBE) and explorer backend are separate
components that run in separate external processes that communicate with the
node via local Inter-Process Communication (IPC).
