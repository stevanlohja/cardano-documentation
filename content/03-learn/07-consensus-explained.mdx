Consensus is the process of reaching a majority opinion by everyone
involved in running the blockchain. Agreement must be made on which blocks to
produce, which chain to adopt, and to determine the single state of the network.
The consensus protocol determines how individual nodes assess the current state
of the ledger system and reach a consensus. 

The protocol has three main responsibilities:

- Perform a leader check and decide if a block should be produced
- Handle chain selection
- Verify produced blocks

Blockchains create consensus by allowing participants to bundle transactions
that others have submitted to the system in _blocks_, and add them to their
_chain_ (sequence of blocks). Determining who is allowed to produce a block
when, and what to do in case of conflicts, (such as two participants adding
different blocks at the same point of the chain), is the purpose of the
different consensus protocols. 


[Ouroboros](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2020/06/23/the-ouroboros-path-to-decentralization/), 
our ground-breaking proof-of-stake consensus protocol, is proven to have the same
security guarantees as proof-of-work. Ouroboros establishes security guarantees, and the protocol
was delivered with several peer-reviewed papers presented in top-tier conferences and
publications in the area of cybersecurity and cryptography. Different
[implementations of Ouroboros](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2022/06/03/from-classic-to-chronos-the-implementations-of-ouroboros-explained/)
have been developed. For further details on each flavour of Ouroboros, you can
