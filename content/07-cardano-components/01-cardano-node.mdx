The cardano-node is the top-level repository for the node, which also aggregates components from other packages: consensus, ledger and networking, configurations, CLI, and logging and monitoring. The node no longer incorporates wallet or explorer functionality. The wallet backend and explorer backend are separate components that run in separate external processes that communicate with the node via local IPC.
