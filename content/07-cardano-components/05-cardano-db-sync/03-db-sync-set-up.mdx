Before you start working with a DB Sync, it is important that you have your Cardano node, DB Sync, and PostgreSQL installed on the same machine.

To get started:

1.  Check [system requirements](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-db-sync#system-requirements)
2.  Install [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/download/)
3.  Create the database and [manage schemas](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-db-sync/blob/master/doc/schema-management.md)
4.  [Build and run](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-db-sync/blob/master/doc/building-running.md) the [cardano-node](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-node) and [cardano-db-sync.](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-db-sync/blob/master/doc/building-running.md)
    

**Using Docker**

Using a Docker image provides a convenient way to package up applications and preconfigured server environments. See how to:

-   [build Docker images with Nix](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-db-sync/blob/master/doc/docker.md#building-docker-images-with-nix)
-   use [Docker images](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-db-sync/blob/master/doc/docker.md#quickstart) when working with DB Sync.
