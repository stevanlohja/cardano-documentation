Cardano is a third-generation blockchain platform that aims to provide the
community with more advanced features than any protocol yet developed. As a
proof-of-stake blockchain, it is built with the rigor of high-assurance formal
development methods and aims to achieve the scalability, interoperability, and
sustainability needed for real-world applications. Cardano is the first platform
to evolve out of scientific philosophy based on discovery, peer review, and
cryptographic research.

Building a strong foundation in the blockchain industry, Cardano has an ethos of
openness and transparency. All the
[research and technical specifications](https://iohk.io/en/research/library/)
that underpin Cardano are publicly published and available to the community.

Cardano’s development roadmap is divided into 5 eras that focus on the
foundation, decentralization, smart-contract and multi-asset ledger deployment,
scalability, and governance of a pioneering blockchain environment. Relevant
research papers and specifications according to the Cardano development roadmap
are outlined below.

### Byron

A period dedicated to building a foundational federated network that enabled the
purchase and sale of ada. The network ran the proof-of-stake Ouroboros consensus
protocol.

### Shelley

A period of growth and development for the network focused on ensuring greater
decentralization, which will lead to enhanced security and a more robust
environment once the majority of nodes are run by network participants.

### Goguen

The Goguen era will introduce smart-contract functionality to build
decentralized applications while supporting multi-functional assets, fungible,
and non-fungible token standards.

### Basho

An era of optimization, improving the scalability and interoperability of the
network. Enhancing the network performance, Basho will introduce _sidechains_,
new blockchains, interoperable with the main Cardano chain, with immense
potential to extend the network’s capabilities.

### Voltaire

A development era enabling the Cardano network to become a self-sustaining
system. Voltaire will introduce a voting and treasury system that will enable
network participants to use their stake and voting rights to influence the
future development of the blockchain.
