Transmission Control Protocols (TCP) and Internet Protocols (IP) form a protocol
suite universally deployed on the network. TCP/IP enables a reliable
bidirectional communication channel between systems on the internet.

The ordered delivery of *Cardano node communication protocols* is guaranteed by the TCP/IP protocol.

Operating systems limit the number of concurrent connections. By default, Linux,
for example, can open 1,024 connections per process, whereas macOS limits this
number to 256. To avoid excessive use of resources and enable reliable means for
connection establishment, Cardano uses a _multiplexer_.

### Connection management 

The network layer handles a range of specific tasks besides the exchange of
block and transaction information required by the Ouroboros protocol.

Generally, connection management implementation includes the performance of the
following tasks:

- opening a socket and/or acquiring resources from the OS
- negotiating the protocol version with the handshake mini-protocol
- spawning the thread that runs the multiplexer (which can be instructed to
  start/stop various mini-protocols)
- discovering and classifying exceptions thrown by mini-protocols or the
  multiplexer itself
- shutting down the connection in case of an error
- handling a shutdown request from the peer
- shutting down the threads that run mini-protocols
- closing a socket

### Multiplexing

The multiplexing layer acts as a central crossing between mini-protocols and the network channel. It runs several [mini-protocols](/explore-cardano/cardano-network/about-the-cardano-network/#utilizingmini-protocols) in parallel in a single channel ‒ TCP connection, for example.

Figure 1 reflects how data flows between two nodes, each running three
mini-protocols using a multiplexer (MUX) and a de-multiplexer (DEMUX).

Figure 1. Data flow between the nodes through multiplexing

Data transmitted between nodes passes through the MUX/DEMUX of the nodes. There
is a fixed pairing of mini-protocol instances, which means that each instance
only communicates with its dual instance (an initiator and a responder side).

The implementation of the mini-protocol also handles serialization and
de-serialization of its messages. Mini-protocols write chunks of bytes to the
MUX and read chunks of bytes from the DEMUX. The MUX reads the data from
mini-protocols, splits it into segments, adds a segment header, and transmits
the segments to the DEMUX of its peer. The DEMUX uses the segment’s headers to
reassemble byte streams for the mini-protocols on its side. The multiplexing
protocol (see the note below) itself is completely agnostic to the structure of
the multiplexed data.

> mini-protocols have strict constraints on unacknowledged messages that can be
> in flight. The design avoids the conditions in which the use of general TCP
> over TCP multiplexing creates chaotic performance.

### Data segments of the multiplexing protocol

Multiplexing data segments include the following details:

- **Transmission time** ‒ a timestamp based on the lower 32 bits of the sender’s
  monotonic clock with a resolution of one microsecond.
- **Mini-protocol ID** ‒ the unique ID of the mini-protocol.
- **Payload length** ‒ the size of the segment payload in bytes. The maximum
  payload length supported by the multiplexing wire format is 216 − 1. Note that
  an instance of the protocol can choose a smaller limit for the size of
  segments it transmits.
- **Mode** ‒ the single bit M (the mode) is used to distinguish the dual
  instances of a mini-protocol. The mode is set to 0 in segments from the
  initiator (the side that initially has agency), and it is set to 1 in segments
  from the responder.

### Cardano node communication protocols

Cardano uses inter-process communication (IPC) protocols to allow for the
exchange of blocks and transactions between nodes, and to allow local
applications to interact with the blockchain via the node.

#### Node-to-Node IPC overview

The Node-to-Node (NtN) protocol transfers transactions between full nodes. NtN
includes three mini-protocols (chain-sync, block-fetch, and tx-submission),
which are multiplexed over a single TCP channel using a network-mux package.

The following diagram represents the NtN operational flow:

![Node-to-Node](node-to-node-ipc.png)

NtN follows a pull-based strategy, where the initiator node queries for new
transactions and the responder node replies with the transactions if any exist.
This protocol perfectly suits a trustless setting where both sides need to be
protected against resource consumption attacks from the other side.

**NtN mini-protocols explained**

A brief explanation of the NtN mini-protocols:

- **chain-sync**: a protocol that allows a node to reconstruct a chain of an
  upstream node
- **block-fetch**: a protocol that allows a node to download block bodies from
  various peers
- **tx-submission**: a protocol that allows submission of transactions. The
  implementation of this protocol is based on a generic mini protocol framework,
  with one peculiarity: the roles of the initiator and the responder are
  reversed. The Server is the initiator that asks for new transactions, and the
  Client is the responder that replies with the transactions. This role reversal
  was designed thus for technical reasons.

To ensure optimal networking service, the team has also implemented an additional protocol:

-  **keep-alive**: a protocol that ensures continuous connection between nodes and minimizes performance faults.

#### Node-to-Client IPC overview

Node-to-Client (NtC) is a connection between a full node and a client that
consumes data but does not take part in the Ouroboros protocol (a wallet, for
example.)

The purpose of the NtC IPC protocol is to allow local applications to interact
with the blockchain via the node. This includes applications such as wallet
backends or blockchain explorers. The NtC protocol enables these applications to
access the raw chain data and to query the current ledger state, and it also
provides the ability to submit new transactions to the system.

The NtC protocol uses the same design as the Node-to-Node (NtN) protocol, but
with a different set of mini-protocols, and using local pipes rather than TCP
connections. As such, it is a relatively low-level and narrow interface that
exposes only what the node can provide natively. For example, the node provides
access to all the raw chain data but does not provide a way to query data on the
chain. The job of providing data services and more convenient higher-level APIs
is delegated to dedicated clients, such as cardano-db-sync and the wallet
backend.

**NtC mini-protocols**

The NtC protocol consists of three mini-protocols:

- **chain-sync** - used for following the chain and getting blocks
- **local-tx-submission** - used for submitting transactions
- **local-state-query** - used for querying the ledger state

The NtC version of chain-sync uses full blocks, rather than just block headers.
This is why no separate block-fetch protocol is needed. The local-tx-submission
protocol is like the NtN tx-submission protocol but simpler, and it returns the
details of transaction validation failures. The local-state-query protocol
provides query access to the current ledger state, which contains a lot of
interesting data that is not directly reflected on the chain itself.

**How NtC works**

In NtC, the node runs the producer side of the chain-sync protocol only, and the
client runs the consumer side only.

This table shows which mini-protocols are enabled for NtC communication:
