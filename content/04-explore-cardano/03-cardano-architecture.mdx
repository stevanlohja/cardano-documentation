This section describes the high-level architecture of Cardano, providing 
details on the core components and their interactions. 

### High level architecture of Cardano

The following diagram outlines the interaction between the system components of
Cardano:

### System components

The _current_ implementation of Cardano is highly modular. It includes the
following components (different deployment use cases will use different
combinations of components):

- [Node](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-node)
- [Command line interface (CLI)](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-node/blob/master/doc/reference/cardano-node-cli-reference.md)
- [Daedalus wallet](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-wallet)
- [Cardano db-sync](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-db-sync)
- [GraphQL](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-graphql) API server
  (Apollo)
- [SMASH server](https://github.com/input-output-hk/smash)

### Nodes and remote nodes

A blockchain system consists of a set of nodes distributed across a network that
communicate with each other to achieve [consensus](https://docs.cardano.org/learn/consensus-explained) about the system’s state.

Nodes are responsible for:

- Executing the
  [Ouroboros](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/#ouroboros-network)
  protocol
- Validating and relaying blocks
- Producing blocks (some nodes)
- Providing information about the state of the blockchain to other local clients

You can only trust nodes run by you or your organization. This is why [Daedalus](https://docs.cardano.org/cardano-components/daedalus-wallet)
runs a node in the background.

#### Node process

The cardano-node is the top level for the node and consists of the other
subsystems, of which the most significant are consensus,
[ledger](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger-specs#cardano-ledger)
and networking with ancillary configuration, CLI, logging, and monitoring.

#### Node-to-Node IPC protocol

The purpose of the node-to-node Inter-Process Communication (IPC) protocol is to
allow for the exchange of blocks and transactions between nodes as part of the
Ouroboros consensus algorithm.

The node-to-node protocol is a composite protocol, consisting of three
‘mini-protocols’:

- **chain-sync**: Used for following the chain and getting block headers.
- **block-fetch**: Used for getting block bodies.
- **tx-submission**: Used for forwarding transactions.

These mini-protocols are multiplexed on a single long-running Transmission
Control Protocol (TCP) connection between nodes. They can be run in _both_
directions on the same TCP connection to allow for peer-to-peer (P2P) settings.

The overall protocol -and each mini-protocol- is designed for a trustless
setting where both sides need to guard against Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks.
For example, each mini-protocol uses consumer-driven control flow, so a node
only requests more work when it is ready, rather than having work _pushed_ upon
it.

The protocol design is modular and evolvable: version negotiation is used to
agree on the set of mini-protocols to use, which allows additional or updated
mini-protocols to be added over time without causing compatibility issues.

#### Node-to-Client IPC

The purpose of the node-to-client IPC protocol is to allow local applications to
interact with the blockchain via the node. This includes applications such as
wallet backends or blockchain explorers. The node-to-client protocol enables
these applications to access the raw chain data and to query the current ledger
state. It also provides the ability to submit new transactions to the system.

The node-to-client protocol uses the same design as the node-to-node protocol,
but with a different set of mini-protocols, and using local pipes rather than
TCP connections. As such, it is a relatively low-level narrow interface that
exposes only what the node can provide natively. For example, the node provides
access to all the raw chain data but does not provide a way to query data on the
chain. The job of providing data services and more convenient higher level APIs
is delegated to dedicated clients, such as cardano-db-sync and the wallet
backend.

The node-to-client protocol consists of three mini-protocols:

- **chain-sync**: Used for following the chain and getting blocks
- **local-tx-submission**: Used for submitting transactions
- **local-state-query**: Used for querying the ledger state

The node-to-client version of chain sync uses _full_ blocks, rather than just
block headers. This is why no separate block-fetch protocol is needed. The
local-tx-submission protocol is like the node-to-node tx-submission protocol but
simpler, and it returns the details of transaction validation failures. The
local state query protocol provides query access to the current ledger state,
which contains a lot of interesting data that is _not_ directly reflected on the
chain itself.

### Command line interface (CLI)

The node’s CLI tool is the “swiss army knife” of the system. It can do almost
everything, but it is quite low level and not very convenient because it’s
text-based and lacks a graphical user interface (GUI).

The CLI tool can:

- Query the node for information
- Submit transactions
- Build and sign transactions
- Manage cryptographic keys

### Daedalus wallet

Daedalus is a full node wallet that helps users to manage their ada, and can
send and receive payments on the Cardano blockchain. Daedalus consists of a
wallet frontend and a backend. The frontend is the graphical application that
users see and interact with. The backend is a service process that monitors the
state of the user’s wallet and does all the 'heavy lifting', such as coin
selection, transaction construction, and submission. The backend interacts with
a local node via the node-to-client IPC protocol, and interacts with the
frontend via a HTTP API. The backend also provides a CLI that enables
interaction with the wallet. The wallet backend can also be used on its own
-without Daedalus- via its API. This is a convenient way for software developers
to integrate Cardano with other applications and systems.

We advise that most advanced users intending to use Cardano start with Daedalus.

### cardano-db-sync

The cardano node stores only the blockchain itself and associated information
needed to validate the blockchain. This design principle is about minimising
code complexity, and reducing computational cost and resource use, to keep the
node's local interfaces as minimal as possible and to use external clients to
provide a variety of convenient interfaces and extra functionality. In
particular, the node does not provide a convenient query interface for
historical information on the blockchain. This data service is provided by a
separate component using an Structured Query Language (SQL) database.
