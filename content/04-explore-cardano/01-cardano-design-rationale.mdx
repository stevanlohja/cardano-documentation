[Cardano](https://cardano.org/) has been built as a resilient and sustainable blockchain using the core
principles of security, scalability, and interoperability. Fundamentally, it was
designed as a [proof-of-stake](https://docs.cardano.org/new-to-cardano/proof-of-stake) system, which means it is undoubtedly more
efficient, by orders of magnitude, than proof of work. Crucially, our
ground-breaking proof-of-stake consensus protocol
[Ouroboros](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2020/06/23/the-ouroboros-path-to-decentralization/)
is proven to have the same security guarantees that proof of work has.

Formal methods, such as mathematical specifications, property-based tests, and
proofs, are the best way to deliver high assurance software systems and give
confidence to users for the management of digital funds. Cardano has been built
using formal methods to get strong guarantees on the functional correctness of
core components of the system.

Security is one of the founding principles of our blockchain. Cardano is written in Haskell,
a secure functional programming language that
encourages building a system using pure functions. This leads to a design where
components are conveniently testable in isolation. Furthermore, advanced
features of Haskell enable us to employ a whole range of powerful methods for
ensuring code correctness, such as basing the implementation on formal
and executable specifications, extensive property-based testing, and running
tests in simulation.

For Cardano to deliver a resilient infrastructure on a global scale, it needs to
be able to scale on par with legacy financial systems. Even though we have
designed Cardano with resource efficiency in mind, scaling remains a fundamental
problem for blockchain systems of all kinds. To get towards a solution of the
scaling problem, our researchers have invented our scalability solution
[Hydra](https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/299.pdf), a protocol that can be executed
on top of Cardano, allowing transaction and smart contract processing off the
main chain. This will multiply the capacity of the overall system by a
multitude.

Performance engineering was used to assess whether design decisions helped us
move closer to the resilience, performance and scalability targets. Distributed
systems performance engineering was applied to anticipate and mitigate issues
associated with long-term, continuous and scalable operations in a real-world
open environment.

Another major aim in the design of Cardano is to reduce centralization while
actively working against economic incentives that would drive the system towards
centralization. As soon as you have [stake pools](https://docs.cardano.org/core-concepts/stake-pools), you have an economic incentive
for these pools to grow, so it was important to make it less attractive for a
stake pool to become too big. It is more cost-efficient to have a small number
of large pools, than a large number of small pools. Cardano was designed to work
against the economic incentive where large pools dominate the system, by making
it less attractive for a pool to become too big. This was achieved by changing
the reward formula. In a naive system, the total rewards for a pool would be
proportional to its stake, so the bigger it gets, the better. In Cardano, if a
pool attracts more stake than a certain threshold (1/k, where k is a
configurable parameter), its reward will no longer increase. So, if everyone
acts in their own self-interest to maximize their rewards, you expect _k_ pools
of roughly equal size.

The ability to interact with other systems, or interoperability, is a
fundamental design feature of Cardano. One of the current design innovations in
Cardano is the use of sidechains, which means that you can compartmentalize the
system and enable interoperability within the blockchain platform. Data can be
kept off the main chain in what is called a sidechain. Multiple sidechains can
run concurrently, so if one part fails, the rest of the system does not fail, as
it is maintained separately. This results in greater assurance and reliability
within the blockchain. By using sidechains you can transfer assets between
parallel blockchains that operate in different rules, mechanisms or languages
and ways of utilizing the network.

Governance is also central to the design of Cardano to ensure system
sustainability and adaptability. A well-developed governance strategy will
enable effective, democratic funding for Cardano’s long-term development. The
Cardano treasury system is currently being designed as a sustainable funding
mechanism to maintain Cardano. It will be controlled by the community and will
enable a decentralized, collaborative decision-making process to sustain
Cardano’s development and maintenance. Various potential funding sources will be
used to refill the treasury on a constant basis, such as the aggregation of
newly-minted coins, a percentage of stake pool rewards, transaction fees, and
donations or charity. With funds being accumulated in an iterative process, it
will be possible to fund the project development and pay for improvement
proposals. In addition, Cardano Improvement Proposals (CIPs), will also be
delivered to foster and formalize discussions around new features and their
development within the community.

Central to the treasury is a democratized voting mechanism where ada holders
will themselves decide how funds are allocated by voting on funding proposals.
This will ensure that decisions are made by a democratic vote rather than by
just a handful of stakeholders. This voting system will influence decisions such
as funding initiatives, authorizing updates to the protocol, and rolling out any
constitutional updates such as changes to the decision-making process, or the
minting of new tokens.
