Here you will find content
that describes and supports the components and features that are live on Cardano
mainnet and Cardano testnets. If you notice any areas of this documentation that could be improved,
please feel free to submit a pull request with your
proposed changes.

## Cardano explained

Cardano is a decentralized third-generation proof-of-stake blockchain platform
and home to the ada cryptocurrency. It is the first blockchain platform to
evolve out of a scientific philosophy and a research-first driven approach.

The Cardano platform has been designed from the ground up and verified by an
industry-leading combination of top engineers and academic experts in the fields
of blockchain and cryptography. It has a strong focus on sustainability,
scalability, and transparency. It is a fully open source project that aims to
deliver an inclusive, fair, and resilient infrastructure for financial and
social applications on a global scale. One of its primary goals is to bring
reliable, secure financial services to those people who do not currently have
access.

Cardano has been designed with security as one of its founding principles. It is
written in Haskell, a functional programming language. In a functional language
like Haskell, building your system using pure functions is encouraged, which
leads to a design where components are conveniently testable in isolation.
Furthermore, advanced features of Haskell enable us to employ a whole range of
powerful methods for ensuring correctness of the code, such as basing the
implementation on formal and executable specifications, extensive property-based
testing, and running tests in simulation.

Cardano is a smart contract platform which seeks to deliver more
advanced features than any protocol previously developed and serves as a
stable and secure platform for the development of enterprise-level DApps. In the
near future, Cardano will use a democratic governance system that allows the
project to evolve over time, and fund itself in a sustainable way through a
visionary treasury system.
